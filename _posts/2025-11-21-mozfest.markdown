<a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/" target="_blank">Mozilla Festival</a> happened in my own neighborhood in Barcelona this year—three days of conversations that crystallized where ethical technology is heading.

Mind that this is not your typical conference with talks and panels, but workshops, hackathons, art installations, pilates, a huge dancefloor, even a fashion show. The venue was Poble Espanyol, an enchanting miniature Spanish architecture-themed park that I always appreciate visiting as long as I don't pay their usual pricey entrance fee. Imagine one session being in the back of a theater, then in the art museum and then at the back of a chapel.

The theme was "Unlearning," and the crowd matched it: grassroots language organizations like Dagbani Wikimedians User Group and Te Hiku Media, civic tech labs like data_labe, researchers from Masakhane, Makerere University and University of South Africa, startups like Lelapa AI, Honcho, and Mozilla Foundation itself bringing it all together.

Getting to be there in person with my CLEAR Global colleague Polly Harlow was definitely the highlight—after years of collaborating remotely. I hope we were able to synthesize our learnings and gave our team a fresh update on the landscape. _And the landscape is shifting fast_!

A shoutout to Francis Tyers for making it possible for us to attend. He's been a collaborator since our Aranese work years ago and is now doing key work with Mozilla Data Collective and Common Voice. It was great to finally meet him and other folks from Common Voice in person. 

A striking thing we noticed was that the notion "More data = better" is being challenged everywhere. The AI Data Real Talk session made this concrete. Keoni Mahelona from Te Hiku Media sat beside a Meta representative and essentially said: "we don't want you to have our data, and if you want to work on our language, go marry a Māori person, and I'm serious." Now that's data sovereignty, not as theory but as practice.

The licensing ecosystem is exploding—<a href="https://licensingafricandatasets.com/" target="_blank">**NOODL**</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15916" target="_blank">**Esethu**</a>, <a href="https://kaituhi.nz/kaitiakitanga" target="_blank">**Kaitiakitanga**</a> frameworks are all trying to encode community ownership into legal infrastructure. It was especially a pleasure to meet Lilian D. Wanzare from Maseno Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence who walked me through NOODL's approach while having our pizza together. Creative Commons just launched <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2025/06/25/introducing-cc-signals-a-new-social-contract-for-the-age-of-ai/" target="_blank">**CC Signals**</a>, an updated open licensing framework for the AI age. <a href="https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org/" target="_blank">**Mozilla Data Collective**</a> officially launched their platform, positioned to help communities actually implement these types of custom licenses. They're already hosting valuable datasets, and we're in continued conversations about potentially hosting CLEAR Global's <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/CLEAR-Global/TWB-Voice-1.0" target="_blank">**TWB Voice dataset**</a> collection there. 

I never fathomed earlier how key the work of <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" target="_blank">**Common Crawl**</a> is in today's AI boom. Pedro Ortiz Suarez explained how they're actively making their crawls more inclusive—asking language communities to share URLs rather than sticking to US-centric scraping of the web. A tiny non-profit running the infrastructure that powers so much of what we see today as "AI."

The three days helped me see where we actually are in this work—not just the promising developments, but the gaps we still need to address. Knowledge sharing is still fragmented, especially cross-continent, but everyone's got an open, learning attitude. Nobody has it crystal clear, and that honesty is what makes collaboration possible and exciting. In this space, standing together is how we shift things.

And finally, the mandatory festival photo with my dear colleague Polly...
