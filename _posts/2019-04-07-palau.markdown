description: Visiting the Catalonia in Numbers exhibition

Today, I was in the data scientists dream visiting the exhibition "Catalonia: 7,5 millions of future". It was my first time seeing numbers and plots of public data in a curated experience.

They've created interactive and animated diagrams of the numbers that represent Catalonia. From the most common names to healthcare advancements, or gender salary breach to rise of unemployment in the past years.

My favorite was definitely the alluvial flow diagram where they let the visitors fill in the data themselves. I was surprised to see how many people out there had a positive outlook for the future. They are the ones who drag the white strings around.
