# Abstract
This paper presents Awal (ⴰⵡⴰⵍ), a community-powered initiative for developing language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze 18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest scale of community contributions—6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of speech data—highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.
