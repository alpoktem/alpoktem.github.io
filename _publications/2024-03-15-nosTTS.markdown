# Abstract
Speech synthesis, also known as text-to-speech (TTS), aims to generate human-like speech
from text. The recent emergence of end-to-end deep learning TTS models has led to impressive natural-sounding results. Nevertheless, expanding these models to multiple languages and speakers poses challenges, especially for low- or limited-resource languages. In this context, we introduce Nós-TTS, a user-friendly web interface for Galician TTS developed under the Nós project. The proposed interface offers a choice among three distinct voices trained on diverse conditions regarding data quantity, training approach, and input modality. Although in an experimental stage, informal listening tests have shown a satisfactory performance of the models.
